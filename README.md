# Data-Mining-using-Machine-Learning
Machine learning and Deep learning project with Data mining

Implemented different Machine learning techniques to predict bank customerâ€™s transaction values.
Data pre-processing, feature engineering and exploratory data analysis were also performed
Machine learning models such as Regression, Gradient boosting, ANN and XGboost were implemented
All these models where implemented in R using R Studio.
Model with the highest accuracy was selected.
